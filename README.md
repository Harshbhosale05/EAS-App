## 🧠 Problem Statement

In emergencies, fear often paralyzes the victim — making it difficult to call for help. Traditional safety apps require manual interaction, which isn't always possible, especially for:
- Women walking alone at night
- Elderly individuals prone to falls
- Children in unsafe environments

More than **70% of emergency help is delayed** because the victim couldn't react in time.
